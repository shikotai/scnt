          p1: "Waste from metallurgical and biotechnological industries represents one of the most serious environmental challenges today, as its accumulation leads to environmental pollution and the loss of valuable resources. In this context, the development of environmentally safe recycling technologies becomes especially relevant, as it allows not only reducing the technogenic burden but also enabling the secondary use of waste as raw materials.",
          p2: "At the same time, the global demand for new high-efficiency materials for energy storage systems is growing, creating opportunities for integrating waste processing technologies with the production of innovative carbon–silicon composites and other functional materials.",
